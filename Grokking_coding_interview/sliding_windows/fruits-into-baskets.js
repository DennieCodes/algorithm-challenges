/* Problem Statement #
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is
to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of
fruit.

You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree
until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

Example 1:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
Example 2:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']

input: an array of characters
output: the length of the largest continuous sub-array that only consists of two characters
limits:

function fruits_into_baskets(fruits) {
	let windowStart = 0,
		maxLength = 0,
		fruitFrequency = {};

	// try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
	for (let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < fruits.length; windowEnd++) {
		const rightFruit = fruits[windowEnd];
		if (!rightFruit in fruitFrequency) {
			fruitFrequency[rightFruit] = 0;
		}
		fruitFrequency[rightFruit] += 1;

		// shrink the sliding window, until we are left with '2' fruits in the fruit frequency dictionary
		while (Object.keys(fruitFrequency).length > 2) {
			const leftFruit = fruits[windowStart];
			fruitFrequency[leftFruit] -= 1;
			if (fruitFrequency[leftFruit] === 0) {
				delete fruitFrequency[leftFruit];
			}
			windowStart += 1; // shrink the window
		}
		maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
	}

	return maxLength;
}

let result = fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']);
console.log('Max # of fruits: ', result);
result = fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']);
console.log('Max # of fruits: ', result);
