# Algorithm challenges and solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various algorithm challenges across different platforms including: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), 
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), and [Colt Steele's Algorithm and Datastructures course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/).

The purpose of the repo is for reference and also my chronology of development as a programmer.
